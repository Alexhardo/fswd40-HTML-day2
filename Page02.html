		<div> Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away</div>
		<div>Now it looks as though they're here to stay</div>
		<div>Oh, I believe in yesterday</div>
		</p>

		<p>
		<div>Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be</div>
		<div>There's a shadow hanging over me</div>
		<div>Oh, yesterday came suddenly</div>
		</p>

		<p>
		<div>Why she had to go</div>
		<div>I don't know, she wouldn't say</div>
		<div>I said something wrong</div>
		<div>Now I long for yesterday</div>
		</p>

		<p>
		<div>Yesterday love was such an easy game to play</div>
		<div>Now I need a place to hide away</div>
		<div>Oh, I believe in yesterday</div>
		</p>

		<p>
		<div>Why'd she have to go?</div>
		<div>I don't know, she wouldn't say</div>
		<div>I said something wrong</div>
		<div>Now I long for yesterday</div>
		</p>

		<p>
		<div>Yesterday love was such an easy game to play</div>
		<div>Now I need a place to hide away</div>
		<div>Oh, I believe in yesterday</div>
