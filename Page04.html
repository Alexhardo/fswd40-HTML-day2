	<h2>History of HTML</h2>
	<p>The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in 2004. At that time, HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000,and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was focusing future developments on XHTML 2.0. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group's charter to expire and decided not to renew it. W3C and WHATWG are currently working together on the development of HTML5.</p>

	<h2>Features</h2>
	<h3>Markup</h3>
	<p>HTML5 introduces elements and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern websites. Some of them are semantic replacements for common uses of generic block and inline elements, for example  (website navigation block), (usually referring to bottom of web page or to last lines of HTML code), or  and  instead of . Some deprecated elements from HTML 4.01 have been dropped, including purely presentational elements such as and , whose effects have long been superseded by the more capable Cascading Style Sheets.[41] There is also a renewed emphasis on the importance of DOM scripting (e.g., JavaScript) in Web behavior.The HTML5 syntax is no longer based on SGML despite the similarity of its markup. It has, however, been designed to be backward compatible with common parsing of older versions of HTML. It comes with a new introductory line that looks like an SGML document type declaration, which triggers the standards-compliant rendering mode. Since 5 January 2009, HTML5 also includes Web Forms 2.0, a previously separate WHATWG specification.</p>

	<h3>New APIs</h3>
	<p>HTML5 related APIsIn addition to specifying markup, HTML5 specifies scripting application programming interfaces (APIs) that can be used with JavaScript. Existing Document Object Model (DOM) interfaces are extended and de facto features documented. There are also new APIs</p>
